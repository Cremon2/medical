Hi ChatGPT! I’m building a simple medical appointment scheduling system web app called MASS, with different user roles like admin, doctor, and patient. I started with:

A base HTML structure including a login/signup page with forms and a modal for Terms and Conditions.

JavaScript managing default users, dummy appointment and report data stored in localStorage, and dynamic content rendering for sections like Manage Users, View Reports, and System Settings.

Functions to generate report summaries and user lists dynamically.

Event listeners for sidebar navigation that swap content based on user interaction.

CSS snippets to style user roles and lists.

I want your help to:

Create a polished, responsive UI that looks clean and professional for all user roles, especially for doctor dashboards and appointment tables.

Implement user management views that show the list of users dynamically with proper roles and actions.

Display reports with summaries and raw data tables.

Add a Terms and Conditions modal with a scrollable content area but hide any scrollbars visually.

Add advertising text on the home page hero section to promote MASS services.

Make sure all JS event handling, including login, signup, logout, and navigation, works smoothly.

I’ve shared:

Sample user data with usernames, passwords, and roles.

Sample report data with patients’ info.

Code for generating dynamic HTML content for users and reports.

The HTML snippet for the modal with terms.

Parts of CSS styling for users and modal.

The signup page and modal structure.

The main page with navigation and role-based display items.

Can you help me by putting this all together into a full, well-structured, and functional example? Also, help me clean up the UI with CSS suggestions and ensure the UX is intuitive and visually appealing.

Thanks!
