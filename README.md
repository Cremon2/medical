I'm working on a role-based login system using JavaScript and HTML, where user authentication and state management are handled through localStorage. The application supports three user roles: admin, doctor, and patient. I've implemented a login and signup interface with tab switching, where users can log in or register with a role. The navbar in index.html dynamically displays items like "Admin Panel," "Doctor Dashboard," "Appointment," "Login," and "Logout" based on the logged-in user's role. Default accounts for admin (admin), doctors (dr.john, dr.smith, dr.emily), and a patient (jane, hannah) are stored in localStorage, and new users can sign up with their chosen role. We've added functionality for patients to book appointments in appointment.html, where data is saved to localStorage and displayed in a personal list. In doctor.html, authenticated doctors can view their assigned appointments, with usernames mapped to display names like "Dr. John" or "Dr. Emily." The project includes improved UI components such as a styled Home button with black text and hover effects. All elements — including login logic, role-based navigation, account creation, and appointment handling — now work together as a foundational multi-role access system. I’m now ready to continue improving the project, such as adding responsive design, redirecting users based on role, enhancing login security, or building an admin management panel.
