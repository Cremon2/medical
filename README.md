I'm working on a login system with JavaScript and HTML. So far, I’ve created a login form that checks credentials and sets login status in localStorage. I want the navbar in index.html to show or hide menu items (like “Admin Panel”, “Doctor Dashboard”, “Appointment”, “Login”, “Logout”) based on the logged-in user's role (admin, doctor, patient). I already implemented localStorage login handling and role-based display.

You've helped me fix syntax errors, define user-role mappings, and enhance the navbar UI with hover effects, styling, and role-based visibility.

Now I want to continue improving the project. Please help me with [insert your next request, like: “adding a mobile-friendly responsive navbar,” “redirecting users based on their role,” “creating individual dashboard pages,” or “enhancing login security with hashed passwords”].
